GET A CITATION MANAGER.
<!--more-->

I think one of the first things any graduate student should do is get a citation manager. There are a lot out there and a ton of resources on how to set one up, but it bears repeating. I did not realize how helpful a citation manager was until it was too late.

Since I'm starting my second qualifying paper, I decided to write a series of posts that demonstrate how I start new projects in my citation manager and how I go through the research process.

I use Juris-M, which is an off shoot of Zotero because I do a lot of work with Supreme Court cases. Juris-M has a lot of extras that are particularly useful when citing case law and law reviews. The best thing about Juris-M/Zotero is that it is open source. Since it's open source, it's free! Free is better. Plus there's a lot of really cool add-ons that are also free.

*Why a Citation Manager?*
1. Citation managers are very useful. Essentially, they do the heavy lifting for you. Instead of having to learn how to properly cite according to various organization's preferences (APA, APSA, MLA, Chicago...), it automatically inserts the citation for you.
2. It also can auto-update them, so if you move sections around your citations will remain updated (this is especially useful if you use footnotes).
3. It's easy to find articles because most (all?) citation managers allow you to tag and link articles.
4. It is a great way to keep track of what you've read.

#### Step 1: Installation
Juris-M/Zotero are available for free. Click here to go to the Juris-M or Zotero download page.
