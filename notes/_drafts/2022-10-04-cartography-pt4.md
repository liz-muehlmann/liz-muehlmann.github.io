This is part four of my <a href="https://liz-muehlmann.github.io/pages/tag-forest.html/#cartography">cartography in R</a> series. The links to <a href="https://liz-muehlmann.github.io/notes/cartography-part-one">part one</a>, <a href="https://liz-muehlmann.github.io/notes/cartography-part-two">part two</a>, and <a href="https://liz-muehlmann.github.io/notes/cartography-part-three">part three</a> are here.  In this post, we'll process the State Park data before adding it to the base map created in <a href="https://liz-muehlmann.github.io/notes/cartography-part-two">part two</a>.
