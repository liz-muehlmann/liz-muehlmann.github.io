        <p><i>Corporate Citizenship and the Threat to Democracy: Unions as a Counterbalance</i> | 2021<br/>
          The Supreme Court of the United States has expanded who qualifies as a citizen within American democracy to include corporations. The creation of corporate citizens threatens democratic institutions because corporations are economically motivated legal fictions whose interests do not align with the traditional understanding of what it means to be a democratic citizen. Since average citizens do not have access to the resources an average corporation has, corporate citizenship   threatens to transform American democracy from a citizen-based self-government to a corporatocracy which has no incentive to be responsive to individual citizens.  Traditionally, unions have acted as a counterbalance to corporate control over people’s working and political lives. However, the Court’s decision in Janus v. American Federation of State has undermined the union’s ability to fulfil its roles as collective-bargaining representative and political association. The Court’s decisions in Citizens United and Janus threaten American democracy because they focus wholly on removing government interference while expanding corporate interference in peoples’ lives.
