I"<p>Twitter is a great resource for engaging with the academic community. For example, I saw this Tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/PhD_Genie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PhD Genie</a> asking users to name one positive skill learned during their PhD. I love this question for a number of reasons. First, it helps PhDs reframe their experience so itâ€™s applicable outside of academia - which can help when applying to jobs. Second, itâ€™s really cool to see what skills other people have learned during their program.</p>
