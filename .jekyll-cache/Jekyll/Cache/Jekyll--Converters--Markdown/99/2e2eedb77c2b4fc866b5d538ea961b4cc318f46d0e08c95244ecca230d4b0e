I"¥<p>This is part three of my <a href="https://liz-muehlmann.github.io/pages/tag-forest.html/#cartography">cartography in R</a> series. The links to <a href="https://liz-muehlmann.github.io/notes/cartography-part-one">part one</a> and <a href="https://liz-muehlmann.github.io/notes/cartography-part-two">part two</a> are here.</p>

<p>In this post, weâ€™ll process the National Park data before adding it to the base map created in <a href="https://liz-muehlmann.github.io/notes/cartography-part-two">part two</a>. Iâ€™ll also add in pop up markers with images from the National Parks Iâ€™ve visited that link to the blog post where Iâ€™ve written about my adventures there.</p>
