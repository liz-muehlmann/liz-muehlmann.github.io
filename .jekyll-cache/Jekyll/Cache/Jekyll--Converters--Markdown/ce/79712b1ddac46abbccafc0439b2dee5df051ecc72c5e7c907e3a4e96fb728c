<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    Here you'll find several non-partisan ballot guides. I try to include as much information as possible without directly recreating the official voter guide. The information is sourced from the ballot guide, calmatters, ballotpedia, LA Times, voterâ€™s edge, and Mercury News. I have included links to the campaign website or wherever most of the information came from.

    I have done my best to keep my views out of it.

    I started this to help my two aunts because they would ask me to simplify their ballots for them. Democracy relies on an informed and participatory citizenry, but itâ€™s not always easy. This is meant to alleviate some of the burden. 

    If you notice any errors, you feel like Iâ€™ve missed something, or you found this guide helpful feel free to send me an email [click the envelope at the bottom of the page]  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;helpful resources:&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Register to vote (Deadline May 23): &lt;a href="https://registertovote.ca.gov/"&gt;https://registertovote.ca.gov/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Check your registration status: &lt;a href="https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/"&gt;https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Access the official voter guide: &lt;a href="https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/"&gt;https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Early voting &amp; ballot drop off locations: &lt;a href="https://caearlyvoting.sos.ca.gov/"&gt;https://caearlyvoting.sos.ca.gov/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Track your ballot: &lt;a href="https://california.ballottrax.net/voter/"&gt;https://california.ballottrax.net/voter/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If you are in the Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange County area and need help getting to your polling place I will either find you resources or help you get there. I also offer to go with you to vote (and I will bring my two large German Shepherds) if you feel unsafe going to vote alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
