I"´<p>GET A CITATION MANAGER.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I think one of the first things any graduate student should do is get a citation manager. There are a lot out there and a ton of resources on how to set one up, but it bears repeating. I did not realize how helpful a citation manager was until it was too late.</p>

<p>Since Iâ€™m starting my second qualifying paper, I decided to write a series of posts that demonstrate how I start new projects in my citation manager and how I go through the research process.</p>

<p>I use Juris-M, which is an off shoot of Zotero because I do a lot of work with Supreme Court cases. Juris-M has a lot of extras that are particularly useful when citing case law and law reviews. The best thing about Juris-M/Zotero is that it is open source. Since itâ€™s open source, itâ€™s free! Free is better. Plus thereâ€™s a lot of really cool add-ons that are also free.</p>

<p><em>Why a Citation Manager?</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>Citation managers are very useful. Essentially, they do the heavy lifting for you. Instead of having to learn how to properly cite according to various organizationâ€™s preferences (APA, APSA, MLA, Chicagoâ€¦), it automatically inserts the citation for you.</li>
  <li>It also can auto-update them, so if you move sections around your citations will remain updated (this is especially useful if you use footnotes).</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s easy to find articles because most (all?) citation managers allow you to tag and link articles.</li>
  <li>It is a great way to keep track of what youâ€™ve read.</li>
</ol>
