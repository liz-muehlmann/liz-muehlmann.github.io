<p>Here youâ€™ll find several non-partisan ballot guides. I try to include as much information as possible without directly recreating the official voter guide. The information is sourced from the ballot guide, calmatters, ballotpedia, LA Times, voterâ€™s edge, and Mercury News. I have included links to the campaign website or wherever most of the information came from.</p>

<p>I have done my best to keep my views out of it.</p>

<p>I started this to help my two aunts because they would ask me to simplify their ballots for them. Democracy relies on an informed and participatory citizenry, but itâ€™s not always easy. This is meant to alleviate some of the burden.</p>

<p>If you notice any errors, you feel like Iâ€™ve missed something, or you found this guide helpful feel free to send me an email [click the envelope at the bottom of the page]</p>
