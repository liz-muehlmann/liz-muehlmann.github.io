   <h2>Hello, I am Liz. </h2>
   <br /> <p>I am a Political Science Ph.D. student at the University of California - Irvine. Prior to attending UCI, I received a Master's in Communications from California State University - Fullerton. I also hold a Bachelor's in Philosophy from California State Polytechnic University - Pomona.
   <br /><br /> My research is focused on institutions and information in the United States political system. I study how American political institutions are threatened and undermined in contemporary contexts.
   <br /><br /> My current projects include a qualifying paper on the Supreme Court's use of the First Amendment in campaign finance and union security cases. I argue the Supreme Court has undermined democracy by creating corporate citizens while simultaneously removing unions as an effective counterbalance against corporate control.
   <br /><br /> Additionally, I research the impact of the for-profit media in the US. My most recent project investigates what effect the loss of local news has on political participation.
   <br /><br /> Before entering academia, I was a wedding and portrait photographer for over ten years. I am also an active calligrapher and lettering artist. Most importantly, I am a dog-mom to two German Shepherds: Lestrade &amp; Dantes.</p>
