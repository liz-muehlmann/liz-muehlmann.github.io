Low wages and high rent have brought UC grad students to the brink. Currently, 48,000 academic workers across all 10 UCs are fighting for justice. The UC touts itself as the gold standard of public higher education yet it overworks and underpays its employees. Across the UC grad students are struggling to pay rent while many are living out of their cars due to lack of available and affordable housing. 
<br><br>
In November 2022, over 38,000 workers voted yes and authorized a strike when it became evident that the UC was engaging in unfair labor practices. The UC negotiation team frequently postponed or failed to schedule bargaining sessions leaving students struggling. 
<br><br>
The UAW and SRU-UAW are currently fighting for fair compensation, sustainable transit options, support for working parents, and parity between international and domestic students. Academic workers are essential to the UCs operation and it's time we are treated fairly. 
<br><br>
I strongly urge everyone to speak out and support me & my fellow academic workers as we fight for justice in the UC.

UC undergrads, your support is very important. Ask your professors to cancel classes in solidarity with your TAs. Join picket lines. Email UC administrators and pressure them to bargain with the grad students.

United we bargain, divided we beg.
