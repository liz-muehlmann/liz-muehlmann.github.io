        <h2>Hello, I am Liz.</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am a Political Science Ph.D. candidate at the University of
          California - Irvine. Prior to attending UCI, I received a master's in
          Communications from California State University - Fullerton. I also
          hold a bachelor's in Philosophy from California State Polytechnic
          University - Pomona. <br /><br />
          My research is focused on institutions and information in the United
          States political system. I study how American political institutions
          are threatened and undermined in contemporary contexts.
          <br><br>
          Before entering academia, I was a wedding and portrait photographer
          for over ten years. I am also an active calligrapher and lettering
          artist. Most importantly, I am a dog-mom to two German Shepherds:
          Lestrade &amp; Dantes.
