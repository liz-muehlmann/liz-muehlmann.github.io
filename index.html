        <h2>Hello, I am Liz.</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am a Political Science Ph.D. candidate at the University of
          California - Irvine. Prior to attending UCI, I received a master's in
          Communications from California State University - Fullerton. I also
          hold a bachelor's in Philosophy from California State Polytechnic
          University - Pomona. <br /><br />
          My research is focused on institutions and information in the United
          States political system. I study how American political institutions
          are threatened and undermined in contemporary contexts.
          <br /><br />
          My dissertation
          <i
            >Culture of Democracy: Community, Norms, and Technology in the
            United States</i
          >
          examines how technology has fundamentally changed how people connect,
          form community, and learn vital social and democratic norms. I draw
          from civic republicanism and communitarianism to argue that technology
          places a barrier between communicating parties and makes it more
          difficult for people to connect their online experiences with their
          responsibilities and obligations as both members of a community and a
          democracy. I conducted 30 semi-structured interviews whose findings
          suggest that without significant changes to how technology is
          structured and used, younger generations (Alpha & Beta) may not learn
          the norms necessary to sustain social or political life. <br /><br />
          However, my research interests are broad. Additional projects include
          the impact that for-profit media has had on U.S. democracy, including
          the effect that a loss of local news has had on political
          participation, the influence of extreme weather events on climate
          change mentions during local political meetings, including text
          analysis on over 100,000 meeting transcripts, and both policy and
          legal analysis, with emphasis on the Supreme Court of the United
          States and Congress' approach to unions and corporations under the
          First Amendment.
          <br /><br />
          Throughout both my academic and professional career I have remained
          steadfast in my dedication to making data accessible to people from a
          diversity of backgrounds and worldviews in public, private, and
          educational settings. I am deeply committed to helping people and
          leveraging modern data sets and tools to pursue social welfare.
          <br /><br />
          Before entering academia, I was a wedding and portrait photographer
          for over ten years. I am also an active calligrapher and lettering
          artist. Most importantly, I am a dog-mom to two German Shepherds:
          Lestrade &amp; Dantes.
